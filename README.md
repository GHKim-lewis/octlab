MESSAGE ABOUT PROJECT STATUS
Hi All,

The OCTLAB project was started while I was a post-doctoral 
fellow in University of Houston (Texas, USA). Since that time 
I was and is working for medical device companies, and, thus, 
could not contribute enough efforts to continue the development 
of this project. That's why, I encourage you to continue its 
development, contribute to this project, or become project 
developer, or even lead OCTLab. Luckily, the same time OCTLab 
is an open source project. So, you can use any parts of my 
previous code under the terms of the Clear BSD license!
